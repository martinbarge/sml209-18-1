<h2>Block quotes</h2>
<p>Using the blockquote tag places quoted text in a pleasingly formatted way. <b>Note:</b> If your quote is in verse form, you will need to use the &lt;br&gt; tag to break the lines.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a verse of poetry in a block quote:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be,_or_not_to_be">
  <p>
    To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br>
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
    Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,<br>
    And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep<br>
    No more; and by a sleep, to say we end.
    </p>
</blockquote>
